# Push Notifications

This is a push notification application with modern browser APIs like [Push API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Push_API), [Notifications API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Notifications_API), and [Service Worker API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API).

## How to run the App

- To run the application, use a live server extension to run the html file.
- To make the service worker api available, first navigate to the server folder by using this command `cd server`, and then run `npm install` to install the dependencies and finally run `node app.js`.
- Now the server should listen on `http://localhost:3000`
